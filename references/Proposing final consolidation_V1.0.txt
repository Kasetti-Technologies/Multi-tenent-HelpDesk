**Proposing final consolidation**

Alright, here's what I need to layout: 
- Features for all the categories like Knowledge Ingestion, RAG, and LLM Orchestration.
- Structural details for things like multi-tenancy, agentic AI orchestrator, and proactivity features.
- Specifics for the tech stack using open-source components for each item.

I think I should focus on making sure we capture all the core functionalities for each area, plus any framework or pattern needed, without missing anything. Let me make this clean and organized!
